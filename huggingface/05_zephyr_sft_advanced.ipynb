        "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
        "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
        "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",
        "* this notebook applies to any decoder-only LLM available in the Transformers library. In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune the [Mistral-7B base model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), which is one of the best open-source large language models at the time of writing."

You can also use it as a garnish for soups and stews. - Mint: Mint adds a refreshing and slightly sweet taste to your pesto. It pairs well with lamb, pork, and chicken dishes, and can also be used to flavor drinks and cocktails. Here are some recipe ideas to use your homemade pesto:\n",

            "- Pasta: Toss your pesto with hot pasta and some veggies (like roasted cherry tomatoes, zucchini, or mushrooms). Top with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped nuts for a delicious and easy meal. - Sandwiches: Spread your pesto on bread, add some sliced deli meat or cheese, and some veggies (like lettuce, tomato, or cucumber) for a tasty sandwich. - Grilled meats: Use your pesto as a marinade for chicken, beef, or pork. Grill the meats until they're cooked through, and serve with some grilled veggies on the side. - Appetizers: Use your pesto as a dip for chips or veggies, or spread it on crostini and top with some diced tomatoes or chopped olives. There are endless options for using pesto, so don't be afraid to get creative and experiment with different flavor combinations. Enjoy!</s>\n",

Use the same amount of nutritional yeast as you would Parmesan cheese, and blend it into the pesto with the other ingredients. Nutritional yeast works particularly well in vegan pesto, but can also be used in regular pesto for a cheesy flavor.\n",

            "- Vegan parmesan: Vegan parmesan substitutes are widely available in most grocery stores or can be homemade using nuts, nutritional yeast, and garlic.

Add in the vegan parmesan in place of regular parmesan cheese in the same quantity mentioned in recipe.\n",

Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM.

LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",

However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it.
